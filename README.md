## Coastal-Wetland-NGGI

This repository contains the public-facing literature review, data, and analysis which supports the EPA's coastal national greenhouse gas inventory. Methodology is based on the previous inventory conducted by [Lu et al 2017](https://github.com/Smithsonian/Coastal-Wetland-NGGI-Data-Public). This workflow is maintained by the [Coastal Carbon Network](https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon).
